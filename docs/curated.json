Understanding and controlling the surface heterogeneity of nanocrystals are essential to the development of advanced catalytic materials.", "updated": [2023, 9, 13, 0, 0, 0, 2, 256, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Quynh N.

By further endowing multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF, a subclass of TADF) with circularly polarized properties, MR-CP-OLEDs can obtain narrow emission bandwidths and may help to realize the holy grail of ultra-small bandwidth.
